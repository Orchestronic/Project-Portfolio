# Image-Selector
This is a project that I spun-off from an online project for expanding cards, in which the premise was that when you click an image it would expand and fill more of the container.

#### New Feature: 

My adaption of this was to update the background image of the entire page according to the selected image in the bottom bar. The image selector was moved to the bottom and made transparent to be able to see the full image on screen.
